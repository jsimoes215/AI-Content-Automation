# Research Plan: Content Library Management and Meta-Tagging Systems for Video Content

## Task Overview
Research comprehensive information about content library management and meta-tagging systems for video content, covering all 7 specified areas to create a detailed report.

## Research Objectives
1. [x] Best practices for content organization and tagging systems
2. [x] Specific vs generic tag strategies for content discovery
3. [x] Scene categorization methods (topic, mood, style, duration, etc.)
4. [x] Search and filter algorithms for content libraries
5. [x] Content recommendation systems based on tags and usage patterns
6. [x] Version control and content iteration management
7. [x] Digital asset management (DAM) systems for video content

## Research Strategy
- [x] Phase 1: Industry Standards and Best Practices - Completed via comprehensive web search
- [x] Phase 2: Technical Implementation Details - Completed via search results analysis
- [x] Phase 3: Real-World Case Studies and Examples - Identified through search
- [x] Phase 4: Integration and Architecture Considerations - Researched via search results
- [x] Phase 5: Synthesis and Report Generation - Proceeding to create comprehensive report

**Note**: Content extraction completed successfully using interactive website tools after initial failures. Actual source materials analyzed:
- Content-based Recommendation Engine Research Paper (arxiv)
- AWS Video Semantic Search Implementation Guide
- Pimcore DAM Implementation Best Practices Guide
- Google ML Documentation on Video Recommendation Systems
- 8 sources tracked with detailed technical information extracted

## Information Sources Priority
1. Academic papers on content management systems
2. Industry whitepapers from DAM providers
3. Technical documentation from video platforms
4. Best practice guides from content management experts
5. Case studies from major video platforms and media companies

## Deliverable
✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive report saved to `docs/content_library_systems.md`
