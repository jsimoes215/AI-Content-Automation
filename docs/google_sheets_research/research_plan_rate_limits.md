# Google Sheets API Rate Limits & Best Practices Research Plan

## Research Objective
Research Google Sheets API rate limits and best practices for bulk operations to provide comprehensive guidance on:
1. Request quotas and rate limits
2. Exponential backoff strategies
3. Batch request optimization
4. Handling API quota exceeded errors
5. Best practices for bulk data processing without hitting limits

## Research Strategy
**Task Type**: Verification-Focused Task
- Focus on depth and quality of verification for specific technical requirements
- Prioritize official Google documentation and authoritative sources
- Validate claims through multiple independent sources

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Official Documentation & API References
- [x] 1.1 Research official Google Sheets API documentation for rate limits
- [x] 1.2 Extract quota details and per-user/per-project limits
- [x] 1.3 Identify different types of operations and their associated costs
- [x] 1.4 Find Google API client library documentation for rate limiting

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation Details
- [x] 2.1 Research exponential backoff implementation strategies
- [x] 2.2 Analyze batch request optimization techniques
- [x] 2.3 Study error handling patterns for quota exceeded scenarios
- [x] 2.4 Investigate best practices for bulk data processing

### Phase 3: Code Examples & Best Practices
- [x] 3.1 Find official code examples for handling rate limits
- [x] 3.2 Research community best practices and patterns
- [x] 3.3 Analyze specific examples for bulk operations
- [x] 3.4 Study retry logic and error recovery strategies

### Phase 4: Current Limitations & Updates
- [x] 4.1 Check for recent updates to rate limit policies
- [x] 4.2 Research any changes in Google API quotas
- [x] 4.3 Identify performance optimization techniques
- [x] 4.4 Find monitoring and debugging approaches

### Phase 5: Synthesis & Documentation
- [x] 5.1 Compile comprehensive findings
- [x] 5.2 Create detailed best practices guide
- [x] 5.3 Generate final report with actionable recommendations

## Success Criteria
- Minimum 8-10 high-quality sources from official Google documentation
- Complete coverage of all 5 focus areas
- Actionable implementation guidance
- Verified rate limit specifications and current policies
