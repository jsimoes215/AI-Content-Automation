  "summary": "This page provides a comprehensive guide to Digital Asset Management (DAM) implementation best practices, highlighting its evolution from simple file storage to a critical enterprise component for brand consistency and operational efficiency. It defines DAM and categorizes its use cases into Media Asset Management (MAM), Brand Asset Management, and Advanced Asset Management. The core of the article details four key best practices: exploring existing gaps and measuring DAM maturity (utilizing tools like the DAM Foundation's model), defining project requirements aligned with business objectives, performing a holistic risk assessment (covering security, governance, and operational aspects), and choosing an implementation approach that delivers consistent value (considering both global and local deployments). The guidance emphasizes stakeholder involvement, phased rollouts, automation, analytics, robust integration strategies, and strong security frameworks to ensure a successful and scalable DAM adoption.",
