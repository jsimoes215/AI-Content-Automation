  "summary": "This page provides an overview of candidate generation, the initial stage in recommendation systems responsible for identifying a set of relevant items given a query. It details two primary approaches: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, both of which leverage embedding spaces to represent queries and items as vectors. The core technical mechanism relies on defining 'closeness' or similarity between these embeddings using various measures like cosine, dot product, and Euclidean distance. The document explains how each similarity measure works, compares their properties, and discusses the implications of choosing one over another, particularly regarding the influence of item popularity (embedding norm) on recommendations.",

        "**Managing Popularity Bias (Dot Product)**: If capturing popularity is desirable, dot product is suitable. However, to prevent popular items from dominating, variants like s(q,x) = ||q||^α ||x||^α cos(q,x) for α∈(0,1) can be used to reduce emphasis on norm.",
        "**Impact of Rare Items**: Rarely updated items, if initialized with large norms, might be recommended over more relevant items. Careful embedding initialization and appropriate regularization are crucial to mitigate this.",
        "**Ranking Differences**: The choice of similarity measure directly impacts the ranking of candidate items. For example, Item A might be highest by dot product (largest norm), Item C by cosine (smallest angle), and Item B by Euclidean distance (physically closest)."
