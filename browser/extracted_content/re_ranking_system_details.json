  "summary": "This page details re-ranking as the final stage in a recommendation system, where candidate items are adjusted based on additional criteria or constraints. It outlines two primary re-ranking approaches: using filters to remove candidates and transforming scores returned by the initial ranker. The discussion then delves into key factors often addressed during re-ranking: freshness, diversity, and fairness, providing solutions for each to improve the overall recommendation quality and user experience.",

        "Re-ranking is the final stage to consider additional criteria or constraints on candidates.",
        "One approach involves using filters to remove undesirable candidates (e.g., training a model to detect and remove click-bait videos).",
        "Another approach is manually transforming the scores returned by the ranker (e.g., adjusting scores based on video age to promote fresher content, or video length)."

    {
      "section": "Freshness Optimization",
      "goal": "Incorporate the latest usage information and new items to keep the model relevant.",
      "solutions": [
        "Re-run training as frequently as possible using warm-starting to reduce training time (e.g., warm-start embeddings for existing items in matrix factorization).",
        "Create 'average' or clustered user embeddings to represent new users in matrix factorization models.",
        "Utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) like softmax or two-tower models, which can process feature vectors for queries or items not seen during training.",
        "Add document or item age (e.g., video's age or time of last viewing) as a feature to promote newer content."
      ]
    },
    {
      "section": "Diversity Optimization",
      "goal": "Prevent overly similar recommendations that lead to a poor or boring user experience.",
      "solutions": [
        "Train multiple candidate generators using different data sources or algorithms.",
        "Train multiple rankers with varied objective functions.",
        "Re-rank items based on genre or other metadata to ensure a broader range of recommendations."
      ]
    },
    {
      "section": "Fairness Considerations",
      "goal": "Ensure the recommendation model treats all users fairly and avoids learning unconscious biases from training data.",
      "solutions": [
        "Include diverse perspectives in the design and development teams of the recommendation system.",
        "Train machine learning models on comprehensive datasets; add auxiliary data when primary data is sparse (e.g., for under-represented categories).",
        "Track key metrics (like accuracy and absolute error) across different demographics to actively monitor and identify biases.",
        "Consider creating separate models specifically for underserved user groups to address their unique needs and prevent bias."
