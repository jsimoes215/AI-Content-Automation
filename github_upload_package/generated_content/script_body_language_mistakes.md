**[Scene 1: Direct to camera with confident posture]**
"Your body is saying 'I'm not worth your time' before you even open your mouth. These 5 body language mistakes are sabotaging your first dates, and I'm about to show you exactly how to fix them."

### Introduction (15-30 seconds)
**[Scene 2: Split screen showing wrong vs right body language]**
"I'm going to break down the specific body language signals that are making women lose interest fast, plus give you the exact adjustments that will make you instantly more attractive."

### Main Content

#### Mistake #1: The Defensive Slouch (30-90 seconds)
**[Scene 3: Demonstration of poor posture]**
"Mistake number one - the defensive slouch. When you hunch your shoulders, cross your arms, or lean back like you're trying to disappear, you're broadcasting insecurity. Women interpret this as low confidence and disinterest."

**[Scene 4: Demonstration of confident posture]**
"Instead, plant both feet firmly on the ground, shoulders back, chest open. Take up space like you belong there. This signals confidence and shows you're engaged in the conversation."

#### Mistake #2: Avoiding Eye Contact (90-150 seconds)
**[Scene 5: Wrong - looking away, at phone, around room]**
"Mistake two - the wandering eyes. Looking at your phone, scanning the room, or staring at the table tells her you'd rather be anywhere else."

**[Scene 6: Right - appropriate eye contact]**
"Maintain eye contact for 3-5 seconds at a time, then briefly look away and return. This creates connection without being intense. Eye contact shows you're present and interested in what she's saying."

#### Mistake #3: Fidgeting and Nervous Energy (150-210 seconds)
**[Scene 7: Examples of fidgeting behaviors]**
"Number three - the nervous fidget. Tapping fingers, bouncing legs, playing with your hair or touching your face constantly. This screams anxiety and makes her feel uncomfortable too."

**[Scene 8: Calm, controlled movements]**
"Keep your movements slow and deliberate. Rest your hands comfortably, control your leg movement, and use purposeful gestures when you speak. Calm energy is attractive energy."

#### Mistake #4: Invading Personal Space (210-270 seconds)
**[Scene 9: Demonstration of space invasion]**
"Mistake four - the space invader. Leaning in too close, touching too soon, or positioning yourself where she feels trapped signals desperation and lack of social awareness."

**[Scene 10: Appropriate spacing and positioning]**
"Respect her personal bubble - about arm's length until she shows signs of comfort. Sit at an angle rather than directly facing her, which feels less confrontational and more relaxed."

#### Mistake #5: Closed-Off Hand Positions (270-330 seconds)
**[Scene 11: Examples of closed body language]**
"Number five - hidden hands. Keeping your hands in your pockets, crossed arms, or clenched fists creates barriers between you and signals you're hiding something."

**[Scene 12: Open, confident hand positions]**
"Keep your hands visible and use open palm gestures when speaking. This builds trust and shows you're genuine. Rest them comfortably on the table or your lap when listening."

### Transformation Summary (330-390 seconds)
**[Scene 13: Before and after comparison]**
"Let's see the transformation. Before: slouched, avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, invading space, hands hidden. After: confident posture, appropriate eye contact, calm energy, respectful spacing, open gestures."

### Call to Action (390-420 seconds)
**[Scene 14: Direct to camera]**
"Practice these adjustments before your next date. Your body language should say 'I'm confident, I'm present, and I'm genuinely interested in getting to know you.' Subscribe for more dating psychology that actually works."
